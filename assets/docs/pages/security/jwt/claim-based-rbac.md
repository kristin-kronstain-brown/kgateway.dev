Use an `rbac` policy with [Common Expression Language (CEL)](https://github.com/google/cel-spec) expressions to allow or deny requests based on the claims in a verified JWT. The JWT filter writes the verified token payload to Envoy dynamic metadata, and your CEL expressions read the claims from that metadata. Because the rules depend on a verified token, configure `rbac` together with `jwtAuth` in the same {{< reuse "docs/snippets/trafficpolicy.md" >}}.

## Before you begin

{{< reuse "docs/snippets/prereq.md" >}}

This guide builds on the [Basic JWT policy](../basic/) guide. Before you continue, create the `selfminted-jwt` GatewayExtension from that guide, and save the sample token. The sample token includes the claims `team: dev`, `org: solo.io`, and `sub: alice`.

## Allow access based on a claim {#allow}

1. Create a {{< reuse "docs/snippets/trafficpolicy.md" >}} that enforces JWT authentication and allows only requests whose `team` claim is `dev`. All other requests are denied.

   ```yaml
   kubectl apply -f- <<EOF
   apiVersion: {{< reuse "docs/snippets/trafficpolicy-apiversion.md" >}}
   kind: {{< reuse "docs/snippets/trafficpolicy.md" >}}
   metadata:
     name: jwt-policy
     namespace: {{< reuse "docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}}
   spec:
     targetRefs:
       - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
         kind: Gateway
         name: http
     jwtAuth:
       extensionRef:
         name: selfminted-jwt
     rbac:
       action: Allow
       policy:
         matchExpressions:
           - "metadata.filter_metadata['envoy.filters.http.jwt_authn']['payload']['team'] == 'dev'"
   EOF
   ```

   | Field | Description |
   | ----- | ----- |
   | `rbac.action` | The action to take when a request matches the policy, either `Allow` or `Deny`. Defaults to `Allow`, which permits only matching requests and denies all others. |
   | `rbac.policy.matchExpressions` | A list of CEL expressions. The policy matches when any one of the expressions evaluates to `true`. Reference verified JWT claims through the `envoy.filters.http.jwt_authn` filter metadata, in the form `metadata.filter_metadata['envoy.filters.http.jwt_authn']['payload']['<claim>']`. |

2. Send a request with the sample token from the previous guide. Because its `team` claim is `dev`, the request matches the policy and is allowed with a `200 OK` response. A request with a token whose `team` claim is not `dev`, or that has no `team` claim, is denied with a `403 Forbidden` response.

   {{< tabs tabTotal="2" items="Cloud Provider LoadBalancer,Port-forward for local testing" >}}
   {{% tab tabName="Cloud Provider LoadBalancer" %}}
   ```sh
   curl -vik http://$INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS:8080/headers \
     -H "host: www.example.com:8080" \
     --header "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{% tab tabName="Port-forward for local testing" %}}
   ```sh
   curl -vik localhost:8080/headers \
     -H "host: www.example.com:8080" \
     --header "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{< /tabs >}}

## Other configurations {#other}

The following examples show other ways to write the `rbac` policy. Each one replaces the `rbac` block in the {{< reuse "docs/snippets/trafficpolicy.md" >}} from the previous section.

### Deny access based on a claim {#deny}

Set `action` to `Deny` to deny requests that match the expressions and allow everything else. The following policy denies requests whose `team` claim is `ops`.

```yaml
rbac:
  action: Deny
  policy:
    matchExpressions:
      - "metadata.filter_metadata['envoy.filters.http.jwt_authn']['payload']['team'] == 'ops'"
```

### Match more than one claim {#multiple}

List multiple expressions to match on more than one condition. The policy matches when **any** expression evaluates to `true` (OR logic). The following policy allows requests from either the `dev` team or the user `alice`.

```yaml
rbac:
  action: Allow
  policy:
    matchExpressions:
      - "metadata.filter_metadata['envoy.filters.http.jwt_authn']['payload']['team'] == 'dev'"
      - "metadata.filter_metadata['envoy.filters.http.jwt_authn']['payload']['sub'] == 'alice'"
```

To require multiple conditions in a single rule instead (AND logic), combine them in one expression with `&&`. The following policy allows a request only when it is from the `dev` team **and** the `solo.io` org.

```yaml
rbac:
  action: Allow
  policy:
    matchExpressions:
      - "metadata.filter_metadata['envoy.filters.http.jwt_authn']['payload']['team'] == 'dev' && metadata.filter_metadata['envoy.filters.http.jwt_authn']['payload']['org'] == 'solo.io'"
```

## Cleanup {#cleanup}

```sh
kubectl delete {{< reuse "docs/snippets/trafficpolicy.md" >}} jwt-policy -n {{< reuse "docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}}
kubectl delete gatewayextension selfminted-jwt -n {{< reuse "docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}}
```
